# DiscreteDifferentialGeometry

A Haskell package for exploring discrete differential geometry (DDG). This is
very much a playground and doesn't have a clear distinction between being
oriented towards pure mathematical explorations (e.g., infinite complexes) and
more concrete computational explorations (e.g., performant mesh processing
code).


A guide:

1. `src/SComplex.hs` - Simplical complexes
2. `src/Exterior.hs` - Discrete Exterior Calculus / Discrete Differential Forms
